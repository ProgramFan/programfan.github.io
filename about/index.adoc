== About the content

This site is a work in progress. I usually write about some Linux/vim/python/c++ tips here.

I am also writing in more detail about my workspace configuration on http://gitbook.com.

== About the theme

This site forks from jekyllrb.com and modifyed to enable latex, fontawesome and asciidoctor integration. All posts are written in asciidoc and converted to html by jelyll-asciidoc. Feel free to clone this site from link:http://github.com/ProgramFan/programfan.github.io.git[its git repository].

== Tests

=== LaTeX support through KaTeX

LaTeX is supported well through http://khan.github.io/KaTeX[KaTeX]. For example, `$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $` is rendered as $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $, and `\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]` is rendered as \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \].

=== FontAwesome support

Test for FontAwesome icons in asciidoctor. This is `\icon:file[]` and `\icon:apple[]` (icon:file[], icon:apple[]).
