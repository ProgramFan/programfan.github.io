= Prevent GCC from optimizing away a snippet of code

Nowadays compilers are extremely capable of elimiting 'dead' code. But in
benchmarking we need some seemingly 'useless' code to do the work we want. For
example, to do computation in registers in order to measure instruction
latency and throughput. In these cases, we need a mechanism to temporarily
disable optimization.

This document keep an up-to-date collections of techniques to temporarily
disable compiler optimizations. These techniques are tested on a recent gcc or
icc compiler.

== Using volatile

`volatile` makes compilers be extremely careful (or conservative) on memory
load and store of a variable. Most compilers tend to do no optimizations at
all (even for proven dead code). So the `volatile` technique becomes the top 1
used.

For example:

[source, cpp]
----
void doTest() {
    volatile int a = 0;
    a += 1;
}
----

`pass:[g++ -std=c++98 -O2]` compiles the above code down to

[source, asm]
----
movl   $0x0,-0x4(%rsp)
mov    -0x4(%rsp),%eax
add    $0x1,%eax
mov    %eax,-0x4(%rsp)
retq
----

`icpc -std=c++98 -O2` compiles it down to

[source, asm]
----
movl   $0x0,-0x8(%rsp)
incl   -0x8(%rsp)
retq
----

== Empty assembly

Another current weakness of compilers is that they are careful with inline
assembly. Some version of gcc and icc tends to leave inline assembly touched
variable intact. This becomes the second technique to prevent optimizations.

For example, Facebook's http://github.com/facebook/folly[Folly] library uses
the following `doNotOptimizeAway` function to prevent optimizing an
expression:

[source, cpp]
----
template <typename T> inline doNotOptimizeAway(T&& datum) {
    asm volatile ("" : "+r" datum);
}
void doTest() {
    int a;
    doNotOptimizeAway(a = 0);
    doNotOptimizeAway(a += 16);
}
----

`icpc -std=c++11 -O2` compiles the above down to

[source, asm]
----
movl   $0x0,-0x8(%rsp)
mov    -0x8(%rsp),%eax
mov    %eax,-0x8(%rsp)
addl   $0x10,-0x8(%rsp)
mov    -0x8(%rsp),%edx
mov    %edx,-0x8(%rsp)
incl   -0x8(%rsp)
mov    -0x8(%rsp),%ecx
mov    %ecx,-0x8(%rsp)
retq
----

`pass:[g++ -std=c++11 -O2]` compiles straightly down to

[source, asm]
----
xor    %eax,%eax
add    $0x10,%eax
retq
----

NOTE: The `+r` modifier and the volatile modifier in the assembly is
essential. `+r` means the `datum` is both read from and write to by the
assembly, so compiler can not optimized it out. `volatile` stops the compiler
from removing the empty assembly. If you try `=r` instead of `+r`, gcc will
optimize it away but icc will keep it.

== Compiler specific pragma

Compilers provides ways to control their optimizer. gcc provides `pragma GCC` as a way to control temporarily the compiler behavior. By using `pragma GCC optimize("O0")`, the optimization level can be set to zero, which means absolutely no optimize for gcc.

For example:

[source, cpp]
----
#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC optimize("O0")
void doTest() {
    int a;
    a = 15;
    a += 1;
}
#pragma GCC pop_options
----

`pass:[g++ -std=c++98 -O2]` compiles it straight forwardly down to

[source, asm]
----
movl   $0xf,-0x4(%rsp)
addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rsp)
retq
----

`icpc -std=c++98 -O2` compiles it down to

[source, asm]
----
sub    $0x10,%rsp
movl   $0xf,-0x10(%rbp)
mov    $0x1,%eax
add    -0x10(%rbp),%eax
mov    %eax,-0x10(%rbp)
leaveq
retq
----

Although icc does a strange transformation to the code, it leaves the code any
way.

NOTE: The above pragma can be replaced by function attribute
`pass:[__attribute__((optimize("O0")))]`
