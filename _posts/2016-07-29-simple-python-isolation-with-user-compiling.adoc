== Background

I would like to have a working python environment with python 2.7.12 and a
series of packages. It shall be efficient, and yet easy to setup. The anaconda
distribution almost satisfies my needs, except that it's unreasonably slow to
load, due to its bundle of system libs. There are also python version managers
such as pyenv and pythonz. The drawback of pyenv is the shims, which are
scripts to launch binaries such as python2 and pip. shims make powerline
client slow, which is undesirable. As to pythonz, it only handles multiple
versions of python, no other infrastructure is provided.

After some experimentation, I found that just compile python from source and
install it into customized location works just fine. There are some caveats,
so I record it here.

== Compile Python

Compile python is easy, just be sure to install bundled pip.

[source, bash]
----
tar -zxvf Python-2.7.12.tgz
cd Python-2.7.12
./configure --prefix=$LOCATION --with-ensurepip=install
make
make install
----

After that, you can find python under `$LOCATION`. `$LOCATION/bin/python -m site`
will show site-packages under `$LOCATION/lib/python2.7/site-packages`.

## Install Packages using Pip

We would expect `pip install XXX` to install packages into site-packages. But
this does not work in practice. Even with bundled pip, it often installs
packages into system's site-packages. To install to the correct location, we
have to use `python -m pip`.

[source, bash]
----
export PATH=$LOCATION/bin:$PATH
python -m pip install XXX
----

== Move Installation Around

I have not yet tested it, but I expect it would be just copy `$LOCATION` to a
new location and set `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` to correct values in new
location. I will try it.
