title: Fix Argument Error with lvalue In Boost.Python

== The problem

http://www.boost.org[Boost.Python] is often used to interface pass:[c++] classes to python. It's easy to use, handles pass:[c++] string and containers automatically and non-intrusive.

http://github.com/Vallioc/YouCompleteMe[YouCompleteMe] uses Boost.Python to export its pass:[c++] classes to python so users can use them in their `ycm_extra_conf.py` file. Recently, I encountered the following strange problem when using `CompilationDatabase.GetCompilationFlagsForFile`:

[source, bash]
----
ArgumentError: Python argument types in^@
CompilationDatabase.GetCompilationInfoForFile(CompilationDatabase, unicode)^@
did not match pass:[c++] signature:^@
GetCompilationInfoForFile(YouCompleteMe::CompilationDatabase {lvalue},
std::string)^@

== The solution

It's strange that the pass:[c++] interface uses lvalue for the object for the first sign. But after digging into the problem, I find that every part of the `ycm_extra_conf.py` works as expected, except that the filename is a reference file chosen randomly from the `compilation_commands.json`. Then it turns out that python load json strings as `unicode` objects but the pass:[c++] part only accepts `std::string`, which is the real difference in the interface. after manually converting the json string to python string with `str`, the error disappeared.

So it seems that Boost.Python handles lvalue well, but has problems with unicode objects and `std::string`. Try to use always python string instead of unicode in Boost.Python interfaced pass:[c++] classes.
