This is a work in progress. I usually write about some Linux/vim/python/c++ tips here.

== Blog

I blog about my experiences on using Linux system daily. Here comes the recommanded posts: 

{% for post in site.posts %}
{% if post.categories contains 'featured' %}
 - link:++{{post.url}}++[{{ post.title }}]
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

== LaTeX support through KaTeX

LaTeX is supported well through http://khan.github.io/KaTeX[KaTeX]. For example, `$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $` is rendered as $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $, and `\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]` is rendered as \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \].
